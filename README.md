# Housing Price Analysis in the Reno-Tahoe Area

## Overview
This project analyzes over 26,000 real estate transactions in Washoe County to uncover trends and key factors influencing the local housing market. The dataset includes parameters such as sold price, date of sale, sqft, location and property features (e.g., bedrooms, bathrooms).

### Main Objectives
- Identify price trends over time.
- Analyze price distributions and obtain key metrics such as median, mean, mode and  min, max prices per city. 
- Obtain which parameters have the most effect on determining prices. 

---

## Conclusion
- Prices show seasonal changes but overall tend to increase over time.
- Given the analysis, cities with the highest median housing prices include Incline Village ($1,500,000), Glenbrook ($1,490,000) and Zephyr Cove ($1,092,500). While the lowest median housing prices are found in Carson City ($376,000), Sun Valley ($380,000) and Gardnerville ($445,000).
- Given the predictive model, the variables 'sqft', 'year_built' and 'city' have the biggest impact on determining housing prices.
