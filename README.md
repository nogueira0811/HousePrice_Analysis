# Housing Price Analysis in the Renoâ€“Tahoe Area

## 1. Introduction and Overview
- **Project Objective**:  
  This project analyzes over 26,000 real estate transactions in Washoe County to uncover trends and key factors influencing the local housing market.  
- **Dataset Information**:  
  The dataset includes parameters such as sold price, date of sale, square footage, location, and property features (e.g., number of bedrooms and bathrooms).  
- **Questions to Address**:  
  - How have housing prices changed over time?  
  - What are the key metrics (e.g., median, mean, mode, minimum, and maximum prices) for different cities?  
  - Which parameters most influence housing prices?  
- **Tools and Methods**:
  - Microsoft Excel was used for the cleaning of the dataset.
  - Python was used for data analysis, including trend identification and predictive modeling.
  - Tableau dashboards to present findings.

## 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

### Data Cleaning
- Fixed typos in city names.
- Removed cities outside Washoe County.
- Deleted irrelevant columns (e.g., agent contact numbers).
- Excluded records with missing critical data (e.g., sold price, square footage).

### Data Transformation
- Standardized date formats.
- Created new variables (e.g., price per square foot).
- Encoded categorical variables for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed price distributions and identified outliers.
- Explored correlations between price, square footage, and location.

## 5. Conclusion and Future Work
- **Summary of Findings**:  
  - Housing prices show seasonal changes but have increased over time.  
  - Median housing prices vary greatly by location, with Incline Village, Glenbrook, and Zephyr Cove leading, and Carson City, Sun Valley, and Gardnerville lagging.  
  - Key determinants of housing prices include square footage, year built, and city.

- **Limitations**:  
  - The dataset spans only 7 years of data. A longer dataset (e.g., 15 years) would provide a more comprehensive view of long-term trends and help account for broader market cycles, such as the effects of economic recessions or booms.

- **Future Directions**:  
  - Explore the impact of additional variables such as school districts or proximity to amenities.
